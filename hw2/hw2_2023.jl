danger(md"I am afraid the following may trigger a really annoying Pluto bug.
I will find out if there is a workaround, but if not please do this and the
following problem
in Jupyter notebooks or vscode.  If you wish to use Jupyter instruction are
[here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl).  If you wish you use
vscode instructions are [here](https://www.julia-vscode.org/).  The issue
has to do with overwriting Base.

I am truly terribly sorry that Pluto is so annoying because the underlying technology of being able to add types is really nice.  I have informed the author of Pluto.
If anyone finds a really good workaround, please let me know.

If all your imports of base and redefinitions are entirely in one cell
I think then you won't have any problem in pluto.

For those who want to delve into this, you can see issues [409]( https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/issues/409 ) and [177]( https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/issues/177 ), which basically says put it
all in one cell, and they have the same gripe I have , that it ruins the flow
of what is the great multiple dispatch story in Julia.

# ╔═╡ 4559691d-b93c-4d66-984f-0560ad458008
 md"
 (3.3) Now suppose that we need an arrow matrix with elements that are rationals, or complex numbers. We could define separate, new types for each of those possibilities (SymArrowRational, SymArrowComplex, etc.). However, Julia provides an alternative that provides, once more, for generic code:

To make a new type SymArrow that can contain elements of an arbitrary type T, such as rationals or complex numbers, we use the following syntax:
"

# ╔═╡ f42dc4ef-8af1-4c4b-a069-94b4460078cc
md"
Here, T is a type parameter: we are defining a template for a new type that will contain elements of type T.

>Task: Redefine Matrix, + and *. These must also have type parameters, for example the signature of the + method will be

+{T}(A::SymArrow{T}, B::SymArrow{T}) = ⋯
"

# ╔═╡ 4c44d9d4-58d7-4081-8f9d-800a3323b247
md"
(3.4)
 An alternative way to define such a type is to use some of the built-in machinery that Julia provides for arrays. In order to do so, we will make a new SymArrow2 type, which we will declare to be a subtype (<:) of the abstract type AbstractMatrix, as follows:
"

# ╔═╡ a7724b60-0c8a-4f83-bcfa-c5be4ea085eb
md"
For a detailed discussion of parametric types, see the [Julia manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/#Parametric-Types) or the tutorial (video from 2016)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAxzR7lMGDM] . (type is now struct)
"

# ╔═╡ d75b96c9-7435-4fc7-b905-b036e20851af
md"
This will allow us to use many so-called fall-back methods that Julia provides, defined for types that to automatically obtain functionality, without explicitly providing it ourselves, as we had to in question (ii). However, this may lead to less efficient code, since the generic versions will not take advantage of the structure.
"


# ╔═╡ e4687b24-add7-4a96-b12e-aef540327c81
md">Task: First, try defining a SymArrow2. What does the error message say? We see that in order to use the Julia-provided functionality, we must first define two methods for objects A of type SymArrow2:
"

# ╔═╡ 62d9f2ad-638e-4444-ba08-7f2d02331e37
md"
size(A), which returns, as a tuple, the size of the array (matrix) in each direction

getindex(A, i, j), which defines what is returned when we query A[i, j], i.e. access to the element at position (i, j)
