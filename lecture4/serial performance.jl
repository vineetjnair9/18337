bitstring(1.0)

parse(Int, bitstring(1))
parse(Int, bitstring(1.0)) # tries to read as decimal, too large
n = parse(Int, bitstring(1.0), base=2) # as binary it's okay
parse(Float64, bitstring(1.0)) # read the string as a julia float, not the bits
reinterpret(Float64,  n )  # recover the Float64 from the integer representation

# Moral of the story: bits are just bits, types tell you how to interepret the bits
# one more example
bitstring('a')
n = parse(Int32,bitstring('a'),base=2)

# types are critical to knowing what to do
a = 1
b = 3
a+b  # you knew how to do this in kindergarten

a = 1.0
b = 3.0
a+b  # you may not know how to do this with the bits

#7b type inference
# statically typed languages -- user specifies the type of everything
# python,matlab determines types at run time
# not knowing how much space to allocate slows things down
# could be int, float, a matrix, etc
# leads to runtime overhead in function calls and memory overhead too
# as values are allocated on the heap

# What does julia do?
# julia knows types of a and b and infers the type of c = a+b
# julia is constructed to propagate type information even if the user doesn't specify types
